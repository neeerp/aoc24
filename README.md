# Advent Of Code '24

This time, we're solving it in Rust...

I don't really know what I'm doing but hopefully by Christmas I'll have half of a clue!

## Instructions
This project builds into a little CLI tool with a simple `-d <DAY>` argument; if no day is provided, then all days are run.

To pass arguments through `cargo`, you'll need to signal to `cargo` that you're done giving it arguments using two hyphens:

```sh
cargo run -- -d 1
```
