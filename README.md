# Advent Of Code '24

This time, we're solving it in Rust...

I don't really know what I'm doing but hopefully by Christmas I'll have half of a clue!

## Instructions
I'm using the [cargo-aoc](https://github.com/gobanos/cargo-aoc) CLI tool and
associated runner and macros. To run the code, use the following commands:

```sh
cargo install cargo-aoc
cargo aoc credentials {token}
cargo aoc input
cargo aoc
```

## Benchmarking
I'm participating in the codspeed AOC challenge
([link](https://codspeed.io/advent)). I'm using both the `cargo-aoc` bench
command, as well as
[flamegraph-rs](https://github.com/flamegraph-rs/flamegraph) to benchmark my
code!
